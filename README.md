# VbRogue

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

A Rogue clone written in Visual Basic.

![Rogue](Documents/rogue.png)

The purpose of this project is as a learning device to...

* learn fundamental programming techniques.
* write a game.
* use Visual Basic.
* work as a team (OSS).
* and do so using http://github.com.

This project is for those with little to no knowledge of programming as well as those whom have tons of experience and everyone in between.  The idea is to have fun while both learning and lending knowledge along the way.

Some of this collaboration is taking place through twitch.tv live-coding sessions that take place every Tuesday 8pm central.

NOTE: The purpose of this project is **not** to create a "rogue-like"; rather, we are using the original Rogue for inspiration and as a target design to build a project for the purposes of learning.  Once we have a "finished product"; where it goes from there is anyones guess... until then, we have a target that can be held steady. ;-)

## Some Specifics

* Use the latest version of VB.
* Building for .NET Core 3.x (current pre-release).
* "UI" will be a Console application.

## Folder Structure

* Documents - Contains reference materials for writing a rogue clone.
* Prototyping - Contains various prototypes that serve to experiment with ideas/techniques that can be leveraged to write the actual game.
* Rogue-likes - Contains several examples I've come across that demonstrate a "rogue-like" experience; including these examples for information purposes.
